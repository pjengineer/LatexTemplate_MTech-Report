Currently wireless \citep{gha} technology finds its widest expression in fixed and mobile roles. In the fixed role, wireless is used extensively for data transfer, especially from desktop computers and lap-tops. In the mobile role, wireless networks provide mobility for use from fast vehicles for both voice and data. A base station (BS) with 100s or even 1000s of antennas we will provide in a centralized or distributed manner, such a integrated system can potentially reduce multiuser interference along with provide a multi fold increase in cell data throughput \cite{wen}. \\
