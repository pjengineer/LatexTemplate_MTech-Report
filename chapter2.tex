%1988  & Edfors et.al \cite{edf}  &used low channel estimators for ofdm channel estimation using frequency correlation of channnel. Used 16-QAM evaluated performance of system in symbol error rate(SER)  \\ 
%\hline
%2007  & Musolino et.al \cite{mus} & a new adaptive identification method for  blind power-line channel estimation and equalization for OFDM communication systems.whenever channel has more nonlinearities proposed method works well \\
%\hline
%2012 & C Chen, MD Zoltowski et.al \cite{vari} & Given analysis of  sparse channel estimation for OFDM based on basian learning  and larger time delay  estimation of the doubly selective channel in a multiple consecutive OFDM symbols will be avoided \\
%\hline
%2012 & F Li, Z Xu, S Zhu et.al \cite{liva} & proposed methods are useful in combat imperfect channel estimation at the receiver side and  low-complex detection techniques based on variational inference proposed for channel estimation  \\
%\hline
%2017&S DÃ¶rner, S Cammerer, J Hoydis \cite{dor} &End-To-End Communication systems blocks will be replaced by trained Neural Networks, performance can be restricted by receiver synchronization and short block lenghts, First time hyper parameter tunning is propsed for increasing efficiency of Nural networks. \\
%\hline
%2018 & FA Aoudia, J Hoydis et.al \cite{aou} &Reinforcement based training for transmitter, Supervised training for receiver, prior knowledge of channel conditions are not needed, Requires additional feedback channel during the training to compensate the feed back losses from receiver to transmiter.\\

% 2019& M Soltani, V Pourahmadi, A Mirzae et.al \cite{solt} & Time frequency channel grid of considered as two-dimensional image which knows it values only at pilot positions. This will be treated as low resolution image(LR) and channel estimated will be considered as high resolution(HR) image. Image Super resolution(SR) algorithm will be applied for converting LR image to HR image.\\
% \hline
% 2019& Z Qin, H Ye, GY Li, BHF Juang et.al \cite{qinp} & Joint channel estimation and detection is proposed, 5-layer fully connected DNN model  into OFDM receiver considering channel as block box, channel estimation is done by internally here DNN model so it can recover the transmitted data without estimating CSI externally.\\ \hline
