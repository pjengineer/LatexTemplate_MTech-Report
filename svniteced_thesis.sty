% 
% This package was written to help students of SVNIT
% Electronics Engineering Department to write a thesis using
% LaTeX2e.
%
% The LaTeX file should begin with
% \documentclass[12pt,twoside,openright]{report}
% \usepackage{svniteced_dissprelim}
% \usepackage{graphicx}
% \usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}
% \usepackage{fancybox}
% \usepackage{lipsum}
% \usepackage{geometry}
%
% The following commands are defined in this package:
% \ssp					Switch to single spacing
% \dsp					Switch to double spacing
% \makecerti			Generates the signature page.
% \maketitlepage		Generates the title page and starts roman page numbers
% \StartBody			Sets up to start page 1 of thesis, after preliminaries
% \GuideName			To provide the name of Guide
% \GuidePos				To provide the Guide's position
% \Degree				To provide the degree
% \Specialization		To provide the specialization
% \AdmNo				To provide the Admission number
% \DocType				To input whether the document is Seminar Report or Thesis Report
% \AcadYear				To input the Academic Year
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% For some environments we switch back to single-spacing, also
% provides \dsp in case you need double-spacing where single-spacing
% is otherwise used.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\def\ssp{\def\baselinestretch{1.15}\large\normalsize}
\def\dsp{\def\baselinestretch{1.5}\large\normalsize}

%\tab command is used to provide paragraph
\newcommand{\tab}{\hspace*{2em}}
\newcommand{\ent}{\\[0.1in]}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \smallssp is used to produce tabular environments in the small font.
% This is required because single-spacing requires a change in font size.
% \scriptsizessp is a still smaller version of the same thing.
\def\smallssp{\def\baselinestretch{1}\large\small}
\def\scriptsizessp{\def\baselinestretch{1}\large\scriptsize}
